# Lead-Conversion-Prediction
Objective: Analyze lead data and build an ML model to predict which leads are more likely to convert into paid customers, identify key factors driving the conversion process, and create a profile of high-conversion leads.

Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover insights from lead data to understand patterns and trends.
Machine Learning Model: Develop and evaluate predictive models to classify leads with high conversion potential.
Key Driver Analysis: Identify factors influencing lead conversion and derive actionable insights.
Lead Profiling: Create a detailed profile of leads most likely to convert, aiding resource allocation.
Technologies Used:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
Data Visualization
Business Impact:
Helps ExtraaLearn allocate resources efficiently by targeting high-potential leads, improving conversion rates, and driving growth.
